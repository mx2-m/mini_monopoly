<h1>MONOPOLY</h1>

<h2> Game dynamics  </h2>
<p>
Monopoly is an American board game for two to six players (in some versions up to eight) in which players take on the role of landlords and, while moving through marked fields, buy or sell these fields and invest in them by building houses and hotels. . Other players must pay rent to the owner of the field on which they find themselves. The goal of the game is to take over most of the fields with a thoughtful investment and force the other players into bankruptcy. After the result - a monopoly over the real estate market - the game also has a name.

### Game rules:
The player rolls the dice and moves that many squares on the board,
  * if he stops in a field with a place he can buy it,
  * if he stops on the "chance" field he gets some chance in the game (eg to go on 2 fields ...),
  * if he stops at the "surprise" field he gets some surprise (eg money)
  * if he stops at the "go to jail" field he goes to jail, he can come out of jail:
       * if he pays 50 
       * if he has a "Go Out of Jail free" card 
  
  The winner is the one who goes bankrupt last
